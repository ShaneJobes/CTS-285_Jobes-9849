Creating the main page, login page, and register page were all very straight forward and easy, but the calculator itself is where things became slightly more difficult. Getting the buttons to update the text input box when clicked was the first challenge, and the AI helped me figure out how to get the page to update properly. The second issue was learning that + - and * are special characters in streamlit so they did not show up on the buttons at first, and I had to add \\ infront of the operator to tell streamlit to display them as text. The final hurdle I came across was during some changes chatgpt made, my buttons started to disappear when something was clicked on, then reappear when something else was clicked on. I was able to revert my changes and prompt chatgpt for a few smaller changes to fix the issues I was having, instead of having chatgpt write a lot of code in one chunk.
