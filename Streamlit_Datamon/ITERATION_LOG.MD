ME: I pasted the code to all of the games before this message:  can you show me how i would take these 4 seperate games and make them in one application with a homepage, where you would choose which game to go play and can return to from the game
ChatGPT gave me a propgram that would create a homepage and some code to insert into all other files, that allowed the main file to call each game and be able to return to the homepage. Needs more work, but the games 
can be played.
